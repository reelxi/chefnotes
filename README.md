# tbh basicly a playground for myself

wanted to build a recipe application for my wife.
on that behalf also wanted to learn new stuff.

## techstack
- ionic, to bring the app to android and ios (new)
- angular, to build the frontend application
- nestjs, to build the backend application (new)
- postgres {dockerized}, to store all the delicious recipes of my wife
