# tbh basicly a playground for myself

wanted to build a recipe application for my wife.
on that behalf also wanted to learn new stuff.

## techstack

- [angular](https://github.com/angular/angular?tab=readme-ov-file#angular---the-modern-web-developers-platform), to build the frontend application
- [nestjs](https://github.com/nestjs/nest?tab=readme-ov-file#description), to build the backend application (new)
- [postgres](https://github.com/postgres/postgres?tab=readme-ov-file#postgresql-database-management-system) {already dockerized}, to store all the delicious recipes of my beautiful wife
- [docker](https://github.com/docker-library), to containerize the whole application
